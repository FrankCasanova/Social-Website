-A follow system using many-to-many relationships with an 
intermediary model.

-Activity stream using generic relations and 
optimized QuerySets to retrieve related objects.

-Django signals, a signal receiver function to denormalize 
related object counts.

-Application configuration classes, to load signal handlers.

-I used Redis in this project to store item views, 
and built an image ranking with Redis.
